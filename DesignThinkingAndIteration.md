# Design Thinking

A way to approach problems in a way that enables clear focus, creativity, and common sense.

## Empathize

- Learn about the challenges that a group of people faces
- **Observe** and **Listen** to people
- Ask questions that get to the root of the issue
- Research what experts have tried before to solve this or similar problems

## Define

- User + Need + Reason
- Example: "How might we get **students** to **do their homework** so that they **retain knowledge** from lessons?" 
- What does success look like? How is it measured?

## Ideate / Brainstorm

- Generate ideas in an unrestricted way -- feasibility isn't to be discussed at first
- Take list of ideas and evaluate for feasibility -- keep in mind the following:
 - How hard is it?
 - Does it get at the root problem?
 - Is there a sponsor of the solution (financially, philosphically, credibility, etc.)
 - Who does it impact?

## Prototype

- For ideas that appeared feasible, make *low fidelity* prototypes -- examples:
 - Paper sketch of a web site or mobile app
 - Bullet points for a new policy/law
 - Rough sketch of an urban plan
- Show prototypes to the people it should enable or that will use the service (get their feedback)
- Fail early

## Test / Iterate

- Deliver in small parts (i.e. work incrementally)
- Continually check-in / make sure assumption and decisions at beginning are still true
- Work together / cross discipline

# Examples

## EmployRI

- [Difficult flow for target audience (online digital literacy)](images/employri_jobs.png)

## Healthcare.gov (before it got fixed)

- Unclear ownership
- Too much upfront planning
- No metrics
- Poor communication across disciplines
- Waterfall
