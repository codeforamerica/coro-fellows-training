# Design Thinking and Iteration

## Case Study: EmployRI

## Research

### Goal

- Define the core problem
- How is success or failure measured?

### Audience

Who is going to be using the app (non-tech: or using the government service)?

## Test a Theory (Quickly, Cheaply)

Prototyping

## Iterate / Pivoting

- Work in Small Pieces
- Continually check-in / make sure assumption and decisions at beginning are still true
- Work together / cross discipline

## Bad Example: Healthcare.gov (before it got fixed)

- Unclear ownership
- Too much upfront planning
- No metrics
- Poor communication across disciplines
- Waterfall
